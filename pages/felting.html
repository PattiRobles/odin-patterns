  <h1>Felting</h1>
  <h2>What is felting?</h2>
  <p>Felting is a textile art that involves compacting and matting fibrous materials together to create a dense, warm, and flat fabric. There are multiple methods for felting, including needle felting and wet felting, the later being the technique we are interested in when it comes to knitting.</p>
  <h3>Wet felting</h3>
  <p> 
    This method uses hot water and sometimes soap to agitate and compress layers of wool, causing the fibers to hook together. Wet felting is good for making clothing, bags, and other decorative items</p>
